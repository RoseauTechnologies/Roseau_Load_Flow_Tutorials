# OpenDSS

This directory contains two tutorials related to the _OpenDSS_ tutorials by [TeamNando](https://github.com/Team-Nando).
The two tutorials of this section use the network of the
[Tutorial on DER Hosting Capacity - Part 1: Advanced Tools for the Analysis of Three-Phase Unbalanced LV Networks](https://github.com/Team-Nando/Tutorial-DERHostingCapacity-1-AdvancedTools_LV).

## Tutorial 1

This tutorial involves modelling a simple LV network and is designed to familiarize the user with the basic workflow of
_Roseau Load Flow_ (RLF). You will learn the following:

1. How to model common network components such as buses, lines, transformers, etc. in RLF as well as RLF-specific
   components.
2. How to build a network and run power flow simulations in RLF.
3. How to access different types of results for various network elements

## Tutorial 2

This series of tutorials focuses on the modelling flexibility of RLF as well as benchmarking RLF with OpenDSS, a popular
power flow solver. It will also demonstrate the interoperability of RLF with OpenDSS. In this tutorial, you will learn
the following:

1. How to convert OpenDSS parameters into RLF parameters
2. How to model networks with a single-wire earth return systems in RLF
