Since we have a neutral in our three phase line (4x4) as well as single phase lines (2x2), then we need to resize the default matrices. Assuming all conductors are the same, we only need to retrieve the impedance and admittance of one conductor as shown below.\n",

This indicates that the power is leaving the transformer as opposed to the positive powers on the primary side entering the transformer.
